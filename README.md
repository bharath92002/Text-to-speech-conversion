# Text-to-speech-conversion:
The Text-to-Speech Converter is a Python-based application built using the tkinter library for GUI development. It allows users to input text and convert it into speech with customizable options. The application leverages the pyttsx3 library to provide text-to-speech functionality. Below are its main features:

Key Features:
Speech Output:

Converts input text into speech.
Allows users to select the voice gender (Male/Female).
Provides three-speed options: Slow, Normal, and Fast.
Save as Audio File:

Users can save the spoken text as an audio file (TXT.mp3) in their chosen directory.
Graphical User Interface (GUI):

Built using tkinter for a user-friendly interface.
Includes text input fields, dropdown menus for gender and speed selection, and buttons for actions like "Speak" and "Save."
Customizability:

The application sets different speech rates based on the user's selection.
Allows file-saving functionality through a directory chooser.
Ease of Use:

The intuitive layout includes a text input box, gender and speed selection dropdowns, and functional buttons for seamless interaction.
Technology Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used:
tkinter: For GUI design.
pyttsx3: For text-to-speech conversion.
os and filedialog: For file handling and directory selection.
This project provides an excellent demonstration of combining GUI programming with speech synthesis technology for practical applications.The Text-to-Speech Converter is a Python-based application built using the tkinter library for GUI development.
